The project involved the development of a model utilizing the InceptionV3 algorithm. The model was designed to analyze input from a person's system or webcam and determine whether the person is male or female. By leveraging the power of the InceptionV3 algorithm, the model effectively processed and classified the visual data to provide accurate gender detection.
